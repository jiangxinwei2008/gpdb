 *
 * The new tuple is stamped with current transaction ID and the specified

 *
 * If the HEAP_INSERT_SKIP_WAL option is specified, the new tuple is not
 * logged in WAL, even for a non-temp relation.  Safe usage of this behavior
 * requires that we arrange that all new tuples go into new pages not
 * containing any tuples from other transactions, and that the relation gets
 * fsync'd before commit.  (See also heap_sync() comments)
 *
 * The HEAP_INSERT_SKIP_FSM option is passed directly to
 * RelationGetBufferForTuple, which see for more info.
 *
 * HEAP_INSERT_FROZEN should only be specified for inserts into
 * relfilenodes created during the current subtransaction and when
 * there are no prior snapshots or pre-existing portals open.
 * This causes rows to be frozen, which is an MVCC violation and
 * requires explicit options chosen by user.
 *
 * HEAP_INSERT_IS_SPECULATIVE is used on so-called "speculative insertions",
 * which can be backed out afterwards without aborting the whole transaction.
 * Other sessions can wait for the speculative insertion to be confirmed,
 * turning it into a regular tuple, or aborted, as if it never existed.
 * Speculatively inserted tuples behave as "value locks" of short duration,
 * used to implement INSERT .. ON CONFLICT.
 *
 * HEAP_INSERT_NO_LOGICAL force-disables the emitting of logical decoding
 * information for the tuple. This should solely be used during table rewrites
 * where RelationIsLogicallyLogged(relation) is not yet accurate for the new
 * relation.
 *
 * Note that most of these options will be applied when inserting into the
 * heap's TOAST table, too, if the tuple requires any out-of-line data.  Only
 * HEAP_INSERT_IS_SPECULATIVE is explicitly ignored, as the toast data does
 * not partake in speculative insertion.
 *
 * The BulkInsertState object (if any; bistate can be NULL for default
 * behavior) is also just passed through to RelationGetBufferForTuple.
 *
 * The return value is the OID assigned to the tuple (either here or by the
 * caller), or InvalidOid if no OID.  The header fields of *tup are updated
 * to match the stored tuple; in particular tup->t_self receives the actual
 * TID where the tuple was stored.  But note that any toasting of fields
 * within the tuple data is NOT reflected into *tup.
